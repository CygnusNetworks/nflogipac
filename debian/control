Description: netfilter NFLOG based IP accounting daemon
 It allows IP based accounting of traffic that is matched by iptables rules.
 Instead of the ULOG the more recent NFLOG target is used. This allows
 accounting IPv6 traffic. Furthermore this software is a hybrid of C++ and
 Python. The performance of C++ is used to count the traffic and the flexibility
 of Python is used to store the accounting information in a (MySQL) database.
