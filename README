Building
~~~~~~~~

Dependencies: Linux 2.6, Python 2.5 or newer, Python configobj, boost::bind,
boost::thread, libnetfilter-log, boost::tr1 (optional)

For ease of maintenance the building process involves both the Makefile and
setup.py (it seemed too hard to incorporate one into the other).

If you want to compile without boost::tr1 (causes a slight performance impact),
you need to add -DUSE_STANDARD_MAP to CFLAGS in the Makefile.

$ make
$ python setup.py build

Installing
~~~~~~~~~~

The Makefile honours $DESTDIR and $PREFIX. For tweaking python installation
paths see `python setup.py install --help`.

# make install
# python setup.py install

Usage
~~~~~

First of all the firewall needs to be adapted to match the traffic to be
accounted. See examples/setup-iptables.sh. Then a accounting backend and a
configuration file is needed. Example accounting backends can be found in
examples/*.py and example configuration files can be found in examples/*.conf.
To write your own accounting backend you need to create a Python file which
defines a class named "plugin". The constructor takes the parsed configuration
file as a single parameter. A method called "account" takes four parameters (a
timestamp, a group, a binary address and the number of bytes). The account
function may block for a while (further accounting data is buffered in a
different thread).
