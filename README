Building
~~~~~~~~

Dependencies: Linux 2.6, Python 2.5 or newer, Python configobj, boost::bind,
boost::thread, libnetfilter-log, boost::tr1 (optional)

If you want to compile without boost::tr1 (causes a slight performance impact),
you need to add -DUSE_STANDARD_MAP to CXXFLAGS in the Makefile.

$ make

Installing
~~~~~~~~~~

The Makefile honours $DESTDIR and $PREFIX. Note that $PREFIX is also used at
build time.

# make install

Usage
~~~~~

First of all the firewall needs to be adapted to match the traffic to be
accounted. See examples/setup-iptables.sh. Then a accounting backend and a
configuration file is needed. Example accounting backends can be found in
examples/*.py and example configuration files can be found in examples/*.conf.
For writing your own accounting backend see plugins.txt. For interfacing
directly with the counters see protocol.txt.
