Building
~~~~~~~~

Dependencies: Linux 2.6, Python 2.5 or newer, Python configobj, boost::bind,
boost::thread, libnetfilter-log, boost::tr1 (optional)

If you want to compile without boost::tr1 (causes a slight performance impact),
you need to add -DUSE_STANDARD_MAP to CXXFLAGS in the Makefile.

$ make

Installing
~~~~~~~~~~

The Makefile honours $DESTDIR and $PREFIX. Note that $PREFIX is also used at
build time.

# make install

Usage
~~~~~

First of all the firewall needs to be adapted to match the traffic to be
accounted. See examples/setup-iptables.sh. Then a accounting backend and a
configuration file is needed. Example accounting backends can be found in
examples/*.py and example configuration files can be found in examples/*.conf.
To write your own accounting backend you need to create a Python file which
defines a class named "plugin". The constructor takes the parsed configuration
file as a single parameter. A method called "account" takes four parameters (a
timestamp, a group, a binary address and the number of bytes). The account
function may block for a while (further accounting data is buffered in a
different thread).
