This document describes the protocol to interface nflogipacd.cpp.

Communication works on stdin and stdout of nflogipacd.cpp. Once the program is
started normal communication can occur without any kind of handshake.

All integers are network byte order.

Protocol on stdin: Each character written to stdin indicates that a snapshot of
the current counters is to be obtained. The value of the character does not
matter. For each character written an END (see later) message is to be expected
on stdout.

Protocol on stdout: A sequence of messages is written to stdout. The first two
bytes of the message indicate the message length as a 16bit unsigned integer.
The next two bytes specify a command as a 16bit unsigned integer. The minimum
message length therefore is four bytes. A receiver should fail upon receiving
unknown messages, because they could contain important information.

Messages:
 * INVALID (code 0): This message is invalid and must not be used.
 * UPDATE (code 1): The message contains a 64bit unsigned integer (called count)
   followed by an address (the remainder of the message). During the last report
   period count many bytes where accounted to the address. The length of the
   address is determined by the parameters given to nflogipacd.cpp at startup.
 * END (code 2): Carries no content data. Terminates a sequence of messages. It
   indicates that a request (character written to stdin) has been fully
   processed.
 * LOSS (code 3): Carries a single 16bit unsigned integer (called count). The
   count value gives a lower bound on the number of packets lost during the last
   report period.

The response to a character written to stdin is (in any order):
 * At most one LOSS message (optional).
 * Any number of UPDATE message.
It is terminated by exactly one END message.
